/**
 * Optional integration between the table node view and the Pages extension
 * (`@tiptap-pro/extension-pages`).
 *
 * Pages paginates by floating full-width page breakers into the document
 * flow. Its injected stylesheet renders `table`/`tbody` as
 * `display: contents` and every `tr` as a `display: grid` block, so rows
 * flow around the breakers and a table can split across pages row by row.
 * This module supplies everything that rendering model needs from the
 * table side; the node view calls it only when Pages is detected on the
 * editor, so nothing here runs — or is even instantiated — in a regular
 * editor. There is deliberately no import from any Pages package:
 * detection is duck-typed via editor storage.
 *
 * All dynamic styling is written to a per-table `<style>` element in
 * `document.head`, NEVER to elements inside the editor. ProseMirror
 * consults the nearest ViewDesc for DOM mutations, so a row or cell
 * answers `ignoreMutation` itself (the table node view is never asked);
 * default descs don't ignore attribute writes, which turns any inline
 * style written from an observer into an unbounded mutation → redraw →
 * re-apply loop that hangs the tab. A stylesheet in `head` touches
 * nothing ProseMirror watches, and rows or cells that ProseMirror redraws
 * later match the rules with no further bookkeeping.
